Stochastic EA

Step 1: Open MetaEditor
Open MetaTrader 5: Launch your MT5 platform.
Open MetaEditor: Click on the MetaEditor icon (a blue and white icon) in the toolbar. This is where you'll write and edit your MQL5 code.

Step 2: Create a New EA
Create New File: In MetaEditor, go to File > New > Expert Advisor (template).
Name Your EA: Give your EA a name, like StochasticEA, and click Next.
Settings: You can leave the default settings as they are and click Finish.

Step 3: Copy and Paste the Code
Replace Template Code: You'll see some template code in the editor. Delete all of it.
Paste the Code: Copy the code I provided earlier and paste it into the editor.

Step 4: Save and Compile
Save the File: Go to File > Save or press Ctrl + S.
Compile the Code: Click on the Compile button (a green checkmark) or press F7. This will check your code for errors and create the EA file.

Step 5: Attach the EA to a Chart
Go Back to MT5: Switch back to your MT5 platform.
Open a Chart: Open a chart for the currency pair you want to trade.
Navigator Window: In the Navigator window (usually on the left side), find your EA under Expert Advisors.
Attach to Chart: Drag and drop your EA onto the chart.

Step 6: Configure EA Settings
Inputs Tab: When you attach the EA, a settings window will pop up. Go to the Inputs tab to adjust parameters like the time frame, stochastic settings, take profit, and trailing stop.
Enable Algo Trading: Make sure Algo Trading is enabled in MT5 (a green play button in the toolbar).

Step 7: Start Trading
Run the EA: Once everything is set up, the EA will start running and trading based on the conditions you specified.
Troubleshooting
Check the Journal: If the EA isn't working as expected, check the Journal tab in MT5 for any error messages.
Adjust Parameters: You can always go back to the Inputs tab to tweak the settings.
